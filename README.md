Topic/Motivation:
We decided on the game show ‘Deal or no Deal’ for our group project topic. Drawing inspiration from a similar project (Who wants to be a Millionaire) completed last year, but rather than copy their idea, we attempted something more original. It was complex enough to apply various new techniques and skills that we’d learnt ourselves, yet still accommodate what we gained from the assignments. Above all, we chose ‘Deal or No Deal’ because once all the work was finished, there would be a fully-functioning engaging game for us to play and enjoy.

Methodology:
Familiarising all members with Matlab’s Graphical User Interface (GUI), used in nearly all aspects of the code, was our first task. After we were comfortable, primary roles within the group; designing the game figures, the open boxes function and creating a banker, were quickly assigned, allowing us to work calmly and efficiently. Succeeding here inspired more sophisticated ideas like sound effects and an instructions page.

The Code:
The user runs HomeScreen.m, and is taken to the home screen where the game instructions are available, or they can jump straight in and play the game. The player is asked to choose his box and then proceed to eliminate a number of boxes before the banker makes his offer. The offer is a multiplication of the mean amount of remaining money by a random number out of a possible range of numbers. This gives unpredictable offers, dependant on whether the banker is feeling generous or stingy. Clicking ‘Deal’ will allow the user to take home the banker’s offer, whereas ‘No Deal’ will continue the game until the next banker’s offer. Once the user has pressed Deal, or continues till the end, it shows what has been won, and what could have been won (had the user clicked ‘Deal’), with accompanying sound effects and specialised messages.
Its GUI was made to look like the original game show set-up, with the background image and blue and red boxes. It includes push buttons for the selecting boxes and options, and figures designed to work smoothly with the codes’ functionality. The bankers offer appears after a certain number of boxes are left, and included adjusting the visibility of different handles, allowing a box with the offer, as well as the ‘Deal’ or ‘No Deal’ buttons to become visible.  


Results:
The end result was far better than our beginning vision for the project. This was mainly down to our improved understanding and usability of Matlab as we progressed through the project, which allowed us to incorporate more intricate and exciting ideas. Playing the finished game with these added extras showed us we’d completed the project to a standard we are very proud of.
